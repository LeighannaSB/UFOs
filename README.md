# UFOs

The purpose of the project was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Deliverables included:
- Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
- A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

## Results

The webpage has been updated to include search criteria for date, city, state, and shape (of the UFO). The search criteria can be entered into the appropriate field on the left side of the screen shown below.

For example, the 'city' search criteria was filtered for the city Fresno. Once the city is entered and the enter button has been pressed the table to the right is updated to pull only the UFO sightings in Fresno.

## Summary

The webpage is somewhat limited by only having the four search criteria. Updating to allow users to filter by country, duration, and any key words in the comments may be useful. It would also be more user friendly to add a button to hit to search after inputing the search criteria- it may not be intuitive for every user to hit the enter key. If the webpage were to be developed further adding a section that pulls current news articles relating to UFO sightings would add extra interest to the page and provide real time updates for the users. Adding a comments or forum section where users can input their thoughts after viewing the data would likely draw more users and/or return users in addition to making the page more dynamic.
